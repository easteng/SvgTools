# Samples

This folder contains various samples and test applications created for the [SharpVectors](https://github.com/ElinamLLC/SharpVectors) library. These samples use third-party libraries available in the [Libraries](https://github.com/ElinamLLC/SharpVectors/tree/master/Libraries) directory.

* **GdiSvgTestBox** (GDI+) A simple test application for quickly testing SVG files and snippets rendering by the GDI+ renderer component.
* **GdiTestSvgControl** (GDI+) A test application for the `SvgPictureBox` control available in the GDI+ component. The `SvgPictureBox` is a Windows Forms control modeled on the `PictureBox` control.
* **GdiW3cSvgTestSuite** (GDI+) This is the W3C test suites application for verifying the GDI+ rendering component.
* **W3cSvgTestSuites** This is the directory for the various W3C SVG Test Suites. It is a place-holder for the test suites. The test suites files are available in different repository, [SharpVectors-TestSuites](https://github.com/ElinamLLC/SharpVectors-TestSuites).
* **WpfSvgTestBox** (WPF) A simple test application for quickly testing SVG files and snippets rendering by the WPF renderer component.
* **WpfTestSvgSample** (WPF) A sample application that can be used to browse directory (and optionally its subdirectory) and view the SVG files in the directory. The name should rather be WpfSvgTestSample!
* **WpfW3cSvgTestSuite** (WPF) This is the W3C test suites application for verifying the WPF rendering component.

Currently, opening the [SharpVectorsAll.sln](https://github.com/ElinamLLC/SharpVectors/blob/master/SharpVectorsAll.sln) solution file will load both the `SharpVectors` library projects and the samples projects.

These have direct reference to the `SharpVectors` library projects and are used during the developments of the libraries.

For samples demonstrating the various features and how to use the libraries, see the [TutorialSamples](https://github.com/ElinamLLC/SharpVectors/tree/master/TutorialSamples) for more information.
